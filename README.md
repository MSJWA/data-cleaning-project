## **📌 Datasets Used**
1. **1000 Books Dataset** 📚  
   - Source: Kaggle  
   - Description: Contains book titles, authors, ratings, and prices.  
   - Goal: Clean the dataset by handling duplicates, standardizing column names, and converting data types.  

2. **Mushrooms Dataset** 🍄  
   - Source: Kaggle  
   - Description: Contains characteristics of mushrooms and their classification as edible or poisonous.  
   - Goal: Perform data cleaning and standardization for machine learning applications.  

3. **Stock Market Data** 📈  
   - Source: Kaggle  
   - Description: Daily stock prices for multiple companies.  
   - Goal: Remove inconsistencies, handle missing values, and convert data types for analysis.

## **🛠️ Data Cleaning Steps Performed**
- **Handling Duplicates** → Identified and removed duplicate records to ensure data integrity.  
- **Standardizing Column Names** → Converted column names to lowercase, replaced spaces with underscores, and ensured consistency.  
- **Converting Data Types** → Converted numerical values to correct formats and encoded categorical variables where necessary.  
- **Handling Missing Values** → Detected and processed missing data appropriately.
